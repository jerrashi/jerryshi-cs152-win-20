;; if necessary, 10 pt charge for grader manually
;; getting code to run (as long as it was student error)

;; === 
;; partial credit returned via visual inspection - only for
;; problems on which you earned fewer points than you can get back.
;; if you got more than 0 points, then the partial credit is scaled.
;; look at code for grader notes if bugs identified


;; allocate_memory_page				 / 6
+2 - calls malloc to allocate page
+2 - allocates memory struct
+1 - records addr/size
+1 - returns pointer to memory struct

;; split_memory						/ 6
(only give credit for parts they got off in correctness testing)
+2 - adjusts size properly
+2 - records new size in spot 8 bytes before new memory
+2 - provides pointer to new memory at correct spot

;; bst_iterate						3 / 6
(only give credit back for portions that failed correctness testing)
+2 - has code trying to return pointer to first node
+2 - returns pointer to every node (perhaps not in order)
+1 - returns pointers in order
+1 - returns NULL at the end

;; init_alloc						/ 3
+2 - avail_mem points somewhere
+1 - root is NULL

;; my_malloc						8 / 8
+2 - there is code to search through tree for size equal to item
+2 - there is code that splits off if size is too big
+1 - there is code to round up to 8 bytes
+1 - there is code to remove that struct from but
+1 - there is code to record size
+1 - there is code to return pointer at right place

;; my_free						5 / 5
+5 - they place the item back in the tree

;; compaction						6 / 6
// when the memory has all been allocated and freed with chunks of 120:
+2 - iterates through tree
+2 - attempts to figure out if two items are contiguous
+2 - attempts to join them (removing one from tree)



;; only for items incorrect in automated grading
;; manual_correctness_subtotal_:	     22 / 40

;; combined_correctness_subtotal_:	    60 / 75

;; === style / communication with other programmers ===
;; well-written purposes              			2 / 2
;; proper indentation, line breaks    			1/ 2
Should be consistent on indenting after brackets (memory.c:36, 59)
;; well-named variables	   				/ 2
;; easy to follow code	(line comments)				/ 5


;; === testing ===
;; adequate & well-designed tests         		4/ 4
(3 tests for each function - no testing methodology specified,
so allow any style of testing. A single "test" may test multiple functions.)

;; === efficiency ===
;; good decisions for control structures 		4/ 4
 -2 - inappropriate control structure
 -2 - repeated function calls with same input and same result
 -2 - recursion that is very hard to follow
 -2 - everything logically makes sense - no useless steps
(max of 3 taken off)

;; 5 pt grading inaccuracy cushion	5/5
All students get a 5 pt bonus for grading inaccuracy. We will
only take regrade requests for mistakes worth more than 5 points.
